          Aspiring real estate developers are increasingly limited in their ability to acquire the level of capital to develop in urban contexts. Government incentives to encourage homeownership have framed the real estate lending market around those interested in building single-detached housing. The costs of real estate increase cyclically. The less developers involved, the less risky projects undertaken, which results in more consistent returns. Lower risks justify higher cap ratios, which result in higher valuations, retaining and passing more of the value to those who have historically held property in cities. 

          These financing hurtles present major barriers to entry in the urban real estate market, curtailing the economic players to wealthy family operations or large multinational corporations.

          There is also a significant misalignment of incentives between local stakeholders and new stakeholders. Economists, like Ed Glaeser, suggest that housing market inefficiencies stem from regulatory stranglehold. While true, there are deeper causes that incentivize the creation of regulation and zoning that stymies development. Current owners have significant incentives to curtail new development, be they individual families, or a limited number of property developers. Existing owners of property are concerned with the housing values maintaining as they are. Housing value is a function of rents, so local rental rates of a direct impact on an owner’s home valuation. As a result an owner will actively block any new development if it may mean lower rents in an area. Due to the way our political structure works, an owner has significant power over the development that happens in their neighborhood, but little say in what happens in other neighborhoods. When ownership is concentrated and localized in any form, nimbyism thrives. Similarly, when ownership is concentrated in an area among only a handful of developers, such developers have reasons to block new development in an area, unless it is responding to demand at current prices. The most extreme case of nimbyism is in San Francisco, where building heights are maintained at low densities throughout the city.

          Houston and San Francisco’s growth illustrates the key division in the residential markets, that between single detached housing and multi-family housing. Single detached housing is driven by supply factors, while multi-family is driven by demand side factors. 

          Where supply is abundant, relative to demand, housing costs decrease. In real estate, the market is rarely driven by supply, which is why housing as a service/good only gets more expensive. Demand is so high in most cities, that developers are able to provide increasingly expensive housing without substantially improving its quality.  The house flipping and middle-class development in the U.S. is relegated to single-detached housing, primarily because urban development is too expensive for the average aspiring developer to participate.

          In single detached housing markets like Houston, where job growth and demand is as high as other major cities, the market is driven by supply related factors. A developer is motivated by new income growth from new properties than, even if greater supply may mean lower rents overall. This is primarily because the number of developers is many, given that the barriers to entry are so small.  The major barrier in Houston for entering the market as a developer is not regulation, but rather capital. Further, properties are so spread out that the chances of a developer facing a lowered income, and indirectly lowered property values, from properties they are developing is small.

          Conventional multi-family real estate analysts are focused on an area’s ‘absorption rate’, the rate at which available homes are sold in a specific market during a given time period. The Conventional assumption is that a developer not enter a market unless there is sufficient absorption of recently built units or low vacancy, but such an analysis assumes that current prices remain the same. If supply were to substantially increase, prices would be brought down. If supply only increases when vacancy is low, then supply only increases with demand and multi-family housing costs are set to only rise

          The idea that the price of housing only ever rises is partly what brought down the housing market in 2007. Like any other good, the more of it is provided, the cheaper its rents. To avoid decreasing localized rents, the single detached housing market trades on space, but the farther housing is located from existing infrastructure, the less inherently valuable it is. Cars enable property to exist at a distance from infrastructure, but even still, there are limits to how far people can be expected to commute. These limits were pushed in 2007 as single detached development was supercharged as a result of collateralized mortgage-backed securities CMBS. Those pushing these loans worked under the assumption that property values were a constantly growing asset and didn’t properly adjust for obvious market risks. The housing bubble’s pop was felt around the globe, but the multi-family housing market in all major city centers quickly bounced back.

          More competition is needed, and more mechanisms are needed that allow people to invest and manage their investments. One potential market-based solution to solve these problems would be public markets for all urban real estate securities. While the equity in REITs is publicly traded, the interests they represent are reflected in only a handful of very large companies. Thus these REITs contribute to the limited number of suppliers in real estate, alongside oligarchs, and contribute to the industry monopolization. Theoretically these REITs could be smaller and more mobile, but creating REITs is a significantly difficult process and it requires that a developer already have significant capital at their disposal. We need public markets that would enable capital to flow to interested new developers hoping to enter the market. Equity needs to be broadly traded such that individuals can be as invested in new development as they are in existing development, across many competing firms.

          Solving these problems will lead to cheaper, better and more multi-family housing, all while distributing the profits to a broader set of stakeholders. 

          This market needs significant disruption and innovation. In a competitive market with little friction for entering the market, developers would have the incentive to create new housing, even if it meant lower prices. If it doesn’t our housing market is destined to bubble up and bust over and over again.
