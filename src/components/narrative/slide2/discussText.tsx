    The average person interested in investing or developing real estate is primarily limited to using financing based on their current income. Government incentives to encourage homeownership have framed the real estate lending market to cater to primarily those interested in building single-detached housing. Further the scale of capital needed for most projects is ever increasing in major cities. 
    These financing hurtles present major barriers to entry in the urban real estate market, curtailing the economic players to wealthy family operations or large multinational corporations.
