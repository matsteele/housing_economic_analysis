    Economists, like Ed Glaeser, suggest that housing market inefficiencies stem
    from regulatory stranglehold. While true, there is are deeper root causes
    that incentivize the creation of containing regulation and zoning.{" "}
    <strong>
      Current owners appear to have significant incentive to curtail new
      development,
    </strong>{" "}
    be they individual families, or a limited number of property developers.
    Existing owners of property are concerned with the housing values
    maintaining as they are, as a function or rents. As a result they will
    actively block any new development if it may mean lower rents in an area. An
    owner has significant power over the development that happens in their
    neighborhood, but little say in what happens in other neighborhoods.
    <br />
    <br /> When ownership is concentrated in an area among only a handful of
    developers, they gain monopolistic power, and have reasons to block new
    development in an area, unless it is responding to demand at current prices.
    When ownership is concentrated and localized in any form, nimbyism thrives.
    The most extreme case is in San Francisco, where building heights are
    maintained at low densities throughout the city.
